## 🔧 System Architecture Deep Dive

### Session-Aware Workflow Engine

**Workflow Structure:**
```
User Input → Session Initialization → Intent Detection → Conditional Processing → Session Finalization
     ↓              ↓                        ↓              ↓                    ↓
  Raw Text    Unique Session ID        Business Logic   Agent/Menu Response   Aggregation/Evaluation
```

**Key Components:**

1. **Session Manager** (`src/utils/session-manager.ts`)
   - Generates unique session IDs
   - Tracks session lifecycle
   - Integrates with Langfuse tracing
   - Manages session state persistence

2. **Trace-Level Evaluator** (`src/utils/trace-judge.ts`)
   - LLM-as-judge evaluation framework
   - GENIAC 40/30/15/10/5 scoring
   - Session aggregation logic
   - Reproducibility hashing

3. **Workflow Orchestrator** (`src/mastra/workflows/sanden/customer-identification-workflow.ts`)
   - Conditional branching logic
   - Agent delegation with context
   - Session lifecycle management
   - Evaluation triggering

4. **Data Integration Layer**
   - Zapier MCP for Google Sheets
   - External API validation (email, phone)
   - Audit logging and compliance

### AI SDK v5 Compatibility

**Endpoint Implementation:**
```
POST /api/agents/repair-workflow-orchestrator/stream
→ Session-aware workflow execution
